              the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line
            of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
            can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
            to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
            wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum 
            and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and
            I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
            in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
            level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've 
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my 
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
